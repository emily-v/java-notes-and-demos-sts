	 * 8. Implement a program that translates from English to Pig Latin.
	 * 
	 * Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing.
	 * It obeys a few simple rules (below), but when it's spoken quickly it's really
	 * difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.
	 * 
	 * Rule 1: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of
	 * the word. Rule 2: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end
	 * of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word. There are a
	 * few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional variants too.
	 * 
	 * See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin for more details.
	 * 
	 * @param string
	 * @return
